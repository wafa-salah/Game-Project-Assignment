# Actual Project:
# Name of Game: Brick Breaker
# Purpose/Goal of the Game:
                # The goal of the game is to clear all the brick found towards the top of the screen without the
                # ball exiting from the bottom of the screen. The way to prevent this ball from going below the screen
                # is by using the platform at the bottom as a landing spot for the ball. The ball, when it hits the platform
                # the left side, the right side, or top of the screen, it will bounce back; when it hits the bricks, it will
                # bounce off of the brick it touches while making it disappear. The player will have three lives per level, where
                # he/she loses a life, if the ball goes below the screen. The player will have an opportunity to win more lives with
                #the gold coins scattered throughout the bricks.

# Optional Features Included:

                # 1) Health Bar: You get three lives to clear the screen of the bricks;
                #                each time the ball goes below the bottom of the screen, you lose a life

                # 2) Enemy/Obstacle: An obstacle brick moving left to right and disrupting the direction of movement (levels 2 and 3)

                # 3) Multiple Levels: The game will have three levels, each level gets progressively harder (ball moves faster,
                #                        an obstacle comes in, one additional life is given per the level)

                # 4) Save points: the player will restart the game on the level that he/she lost.
